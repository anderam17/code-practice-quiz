# code-practice-quiz

## Function

The goal of this homework assignment was to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app features dynamic HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. The user first sees a welcome page with instructions and a start button. When the button is clicked, a timer in the top right corner begins counting down from 60 and the first question appears. The user answers the questions by clicking on one of the answer choices. If they were correct, they earn 20 points. If they are incorrect, 20 points are taken away from their time. When the quiz is over, the users score is displayed and the user can then enter their initials to be added to a list of highscores to compare to past attempts. The user also has the option to clear the list of high scores.
